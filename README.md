This project involves the analysis of incident management data. The notebook processes and visualizes data related to incidents, including their categorization, threat levels, and time-related attributes.

## Project Overview

This project includes the following key steps:
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The dataset is loaded, and various preprocessing steps such as date parsing and handling missing values are performed.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and summaries of the data are provided to understand the distribution and trends of incidents over time.
- **Modeling (If Applicable):** Any predictive modeling or data analysis techniques applied to the dataset.
- **Conclusion:** Final insights derived from the analysis.
